The gobl_search tool gives targeted search over the GOBL (Global Open Business Language) specification and associated extension guides. When provided with a query, it retrieves schema definitions, field-level explanations, technical notes, and real-world examples for invoices, credit notes, payment terms, and other fiscal documents. It also surfaces country-specific extensions and legal compliance details—such as mandatory fields, custom code lists, and localization requirements—for each jurisdiction supported by Invopop. By using this tool, the agent can validate or construct GOBL payloads, illustrate correct JSON structures, and answer any question about the format’s semantics or country-driven variations with confidence.

All the sources are in the following URL: https://docs.gobl.org/. This means that if the source received is draft-0/bill/invoice, the URL to the source that you should cite is https://docs.gobl.org/draft-0/bill/invoice.
