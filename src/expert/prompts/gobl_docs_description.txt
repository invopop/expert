This function provides access to the full breadth of GOBL (Go Business Language) official documentation.

Use this tool to answer questions about GOBL (Invopop's invoice format). The information presented in this docs include:
- Format, schema and fields of the 4 main business documents supported by GOBL: Invoice, Order, Delivery and Payment
- Details about all the subobjects that compose the previous ones (e.g. lines, parties, taxes, totals ...) and field-level explanations.
- Regime information for every country with the tax categories, rates and invoice type supported
- Information on how to get started with GOBL and how to use the builder to create an invoice
- Addons which provide additional normalization methods, validation rules and extension definitions that augment the basic functionality of a GOBL document with the characteristics of a specific invoice format. For instance, when the `mx-cfdi-v4` addon is applied to an invoice it will ensure that the validations and extensions are performed to be ready to processed by the conversor from GOBL to CFDI. We have one addon per invoice format.
- Catalogues which are sets of extensions that may be used between multiple addons or tax regimes.
- Country-specific extensions and legal compliance details—such as mandatory fields, custom code lists, and localization requirements—for each jurisdiction supported by Invopop. 

By using this tool, the agent can validate or construct GOBL payloads, illustrate correct JSON structures, and answer any question about the format’s semantics or country-driven variations with confidence.

Results return relevant document titles, section headings, and text snippets, enabling the agent to precisely locate the authoritative source for any client question.

All the sources are in the following URL: https://docs.gobl.org/. This means that if the source received is draft-0/bill/invoice, the URL to the source that you should cite is https://docs.gobl.org/draft-0/bill/invoice.
