The invopop_search tool provides deep, programmatic access to the full breadth of Invopop’s official documentation. When invoked with a natural-language query, it combs through user guides, configuration workflows, country-specific e-invoicing regulations, white-labeling instructions, built-in app integrations (e.g. Slack notifications, email dispatch, PDF rendering, exchange-rate updates), third-party connectors (e.g. Stripe, Chargebee), and the complete API reference—including authentication, silo entry creation, workflow orchestration, invoice lookup, status checks, and more. Results return relevant document titles, section headings, and text snippets, enabling the agent to precisely locate the authoritative source for any client question. Use this tool first for all questions about Invopop’s platform behavior, setup, customization, and integrations to ensure responses are grounded in the latest official guidance.

In Invopop documentation, you can also find examples about invoice formats in each country.

All the sources are in the following URL: https://docs.invopop.com/. This means that if the source received is guides/features/workflows, the URL to the source that you should cite is https://docs.invopop.com/guides/features/workflows.
